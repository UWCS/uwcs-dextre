## About
uwcs-dextre is the latest in a long line of University of Warwick Computing Society websites, started immediately before the 2020-21 academic year. The site uses Python, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail) (currently).

The name 'Dextre' comes from the ISS module of the same name. The previous website, named 'Zarya', shares a name with another eponymous module of the ISS. The name for that version having been derived from the computer game Overwatch.

## Development
Instructions on getting started on development on Dextre can be found in the [developer documentation](/docs/developing.md). Information on Dextre's architecture and dependencies can be found in the [architecture documentation](/docs/architecture.md).
