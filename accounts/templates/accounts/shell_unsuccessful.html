    <p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately the username that you've provided for your shell account ({{ username }}) is in use, which means that we can't create a shell account for you. No worries though, just reply to this email or send an email to<a href="mailto:techteam@uwcs.co.uk">techteam@uwcs.co.uk</a> explaining the situation and we'll sort things out for you.</p>
    <p>Kind regards,<br/>
    UWCS Techteam</p>
