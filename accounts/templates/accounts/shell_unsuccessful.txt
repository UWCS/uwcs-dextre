Hi {{ first_name }},

Unfortunately the username that you've provided for your shell account ({{ username }}) is in use, which means that we can't create a shell account for you. No worries though, just reply to this email or send an email to techteam@uwcs.co.uk explaining the situation and we'll sort things out for you.

Kind regards,
UWCS Techteam
